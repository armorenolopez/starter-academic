As a developer with 9 years of experience and I have worked with clients from both the US and Mexico. I have worked with several technologies and I am always looking for new challenges and knowledge. During these recent years he had the opportunity to implement solutions and resolve problems with Software. Most of the time I have worked under agile methodologies like SCRUM and Scrumban.


I am a very committed person who knows how to collaborate in teamwork. I also look to using the latest technologies and the way to integrate those improvements to my daily work. I am already part of this great company; but I would like to start developing other skills I have such as:

* Development and management of databases.
* Capability for hard work loads and accomplishment delivering dates.
* Good performance of logic in several programming languages.
* Good analysis, critical thinking and good problem solving skills.
